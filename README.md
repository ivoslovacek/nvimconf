# My Neovim configuration

This is my personal configuration which I use in [Neovim](https://neovim.io/).

## Installation

Firstly we have to make sure we have [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) installed.

If you use an [arch](https://archlinux.org/) based distro, you can install it using
```bash
sudo pacman -S neovim
```

Then we simple clone this repository to our config folder

By default it is located in `~/.config/nvim`
